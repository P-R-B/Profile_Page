   <h2>Context</h2>
   <p>My name is Patrick and I hold a master's degree in mechanical engineering. This subject
      appeals to my creative passion, along with the logical reasoning skills required to assess
      the feasibility of those concepts within the constraints of reality.<br>
      Engineering presents a fascinating dilemma of having to follow a methodical process to
      solving challenges to provide consistency in the results in accordance with best practice,
      yet also requiring novelty in the process, redefining the method to push the boundaries of
      what is considered possible with technology.                                               </p>

   <p>The curriculum involved some programming, primarily with MATLAB for solving differential
      equations, however later into my course I used Ansys and Abaqus for solid structural
      mechanics and fluid flow simulations. However the simulation softwares relied more on
      CAD and boundary conditions than manually typing scripts of code.                          </p>

   <p>Nevertheless, my education at university only covered the theoretical aspects of the 
      subject. To learn practically, I had to get my hands dirty, building upon my academic
      credentials by maintaining, repairing and in some cases even modifying domestic appliances,
      such as the family oven, bicycle and even the laptop, which at six years old is still
      running Counter Strike: Global Offensive as if it were brand new.                          </p>
  
   <p>As an extracurricular activity, I have also studied electronics, and have become skilled at
      soldering wires and components, having designed and built circuitry for IMechE group design
      challenges in my first two years of my undergraduate course, then for my dissertation the
      following year.                                                                            </p>

   <h2>Motive</h2>

   <p>My decision to pursue web development is a cumulation of a multitude of variables at play,
      some of which are covered below:                                                           </p>

      <h3>Exploring a New Job Market</h3>
  
      <p>Despite the rising tuition fees, a university degree unfortunately is considerably less
         valuable than it used to be. With multiple mechanical engineering graduates to select 
         from, employers are spoilt for choice, and can afford to be selective, drawing a 
         Christmas list of requirements.                                                         </p>

      <p>One of those requirements is the Catch-22 of demanding years of industry-related work
         experience prior to starting the job. In other words, you need experience to land the 
         job, yet you also need the job to get the experience in the first place.                </p>

      <p>Learning to code would broaden my options for entrance into a professional technical 
         career.                                                                                 </p>
     </div>

     <div class="Cell">                             <!--Appears as a cyan box within the green box-->
      <h3>Broadening My Skill Base</h3>

      <p>Self-sufficiency is always a useful asset to possess. I find it empowering to be less
         dependant on my peers to solve my problems for me. Furthermore, being able to solve
         problems for others makes me a valuable utility, giving me great negotiating power 
         where certain situations arise.                                                         </p>

      <p>Then of course, having a high-demand skill to mention on my C.V. (even peripherally) 
         would boost my chances of landing a lucrative engineering career.                       </p>

      <p>Given how much of an integral part to society the world wide web plays, learning how it
         works would prove highly beneficial to adapting to thrive under an ever-developing 
         economy. This is elaborated upon in the next subsection.                                </p>
     </div>

     <div class="Cell">                             <!--Appears as a cyan box within the green box-->
      <h3>Marketing</h3>

      <p>Should I ever have products or services to sell, knowing how to create webistes would 
         grant me tremendous leverage with selling them, being able to establish a more 
         sophisticated brand and not having to rely on third-party sites such as Ebay. This way, 
         I can avoid having to pay commissions on sales, subsequently making my returns more 
         efficient.                                                                              </p>

      <p>Then there is the marketing of ideas.<br> Given the growing censorship on social media 
         platforms, having my own websites would enable me to share philosophies more freely,
         unconstrained by the prevailing dogmas of the day propagated by society and the state.  </p>

   <h2>Educational Progress</h2>

   <p>To prepare myself for this course, firstly, I have worked on a couple of the projects that 
      were specified on the Founders and Coders website prior to the amendment.<br>
      The links to those projects can be found below:                                            </p>

     <p>I had a lot of fun producing this game. This is a 2-D platform adventure game with the 
        following features:                                                                      </p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Unique gameplay mechanics</strong><br>
          In mid-air,
          the protagonist can flap a limited number of times to gain additional altitude.       </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Multiple endings</strong><br>
          There are three different outcomes from completing the game. This is to make the
          gameplot more expansive, such that it doesn't follow the standard rigid linear 
          format of most platformers and gives the story more depth.                            </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Multi-level scrolling</strong><br>
          The immersion adds to the adventure element of the game.                              </li>
      <br>       
      <li><strong>Custom models</strong><br>
          You won't find any of the game models anywhere else on the internet. You know why?<br>
          Because they were all drawn by yours truly using Paint.NET. This makes the game
          fresh, innovative and original.                                                       </li>

      <h3>Estuary & Sea Fishing</h3>
  
      <p>My passion for hunting lies in the strategic preparations to predict when and where the
         prey will show up, combined with the tactics required to successfully land them.        </p>
      <p>What I admire about fishing the London and Sussex estuaries and coasts in particular are
         the variety of fish species that coincide with fluctuations in the seasons, tidal 
         patterns and weather. This maintains a sense of novelty in the sport, as I am always 
         hyped up about the different flavour of fish the next season will bring:                </p>
         <ul>
          <li><strong>Mullet</strong> are bulky, slow-moving but powerful fish that swim
              up estuaries in the summer months. As they are timid fish that tend not to take
              bait, I catch them by casting nets over them (Some fish get caught <em>not</em>
              because they open their mouths >8-D). Unlike the other two species listed
              below, mullet are scaly and slimy, making them a nuisance to fillet. I typically
              descale and fillet them on-site, and dump the rest of their carcasses back into
              the estuary, only taking the fillets home. Rising neap tides are best for them.   </li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Mackerel</strong> (a member of the tuna family) are fast swimmers that are 
              most frequent from late summer to mid autumn. They either show up in large shoals, 
              or they don't show up at all. I catch them on flashy strip lures and whilst I 
              don't enjoy the taste of them that much, their oily flesh makes them excellent 
              bait. Rising neap tides are best for them.                                        </li>
          <br>    
          <li><strong>Whiting</strong> (a member of the cod family) are most frequent from late 
              autumn to early winter. They are far from fussy eaters, taking a large variety of 
              bait, although I prefer to use worms and salted mackerel strips for them. These 
              fish make excellent fillets; I'd coat their flesh in egg and then flour, then fry 
              them, savouring their soft texture. Rising spring tides are best for them.        </li>
         </ul>
      <p>Every unique species I catch, I consider as a great achievement, and boosts my 
         confidence to raise the stakes to target even bigger game!</p>

      <h3>Cycling</h3>

      <p>Whilst I engage in a variety of sports, the reasons why I am so adamant in including
         cycling in this section and not others is that there are more variables that spark my
         interest in it.                                                                         </p>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Thrill</strong><br>
           The sensation of the cool wind brushing against my skin on a summer's dusk is
           liberating and reminds me of the awe of being outside. The sensation is comparable to
           that from a motorcycle ride, albeit to a lesser extent.                              </li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>Freedom</strong><br>
           I tend to cycle long distances from my home and actually prefer creating that space,
           as it gives me a sense of relief from my ordinary domestic routine.                  </li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>Introspection</strong><br>
           While it may sound counterintuitive to most, I prefer to cycle at dusk/night when the
           streets are less busy as I have more free passage to cycle and can therefore travel
           faster. Moreover, I much prefer the tranquility it offers, which places me in a 
           superior position to reflect on my day and envision my destiny lying ahead.          </li>
       <br>    
       <li><strong>Exploration</strong><br>
           Cycling broadens my range of man-powered travel, as I am able to cover ground much
           more rapidly than I would on foot. In fact, for short distances (within 10 km), it is
           more convenient and quicker than by bus. This greatly increases my accessibility of
           locations in and around west London.                                                 </li>

      <h3>D.I.Y.</h3>

      <p>My adamance to design and create sees me partaking in practical work, often where
         precision and dexterity are required. I assume responsibility for repairing 
         faulty domestic gadgets, appliances and tools 
         (phones, laptops, smartphones, ovens, bicycles, scooters etc.).
         While it is relieving to restore the functionality of our items, my main motive for
         doing so are the skills I develop in the process, such as:                              </p>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Reverse-engineering</strong><br>
           Unsurprisingly, my maintenance projects have had me disassemble a multitude of items.
           Doing so is the most efficient way to learn what makes them tick, then replicate 
           (or better still, <em>build upon</em>) that technology if I wanted to create 
           similar-purpose products in the future.                                              </li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong><br>
           Locating and identifying the root cause of a problem is a crucial milestone that has
           to be reached before a pragmatic solution to it can be devised. Being able to 
           fault-find has significantly reduced the time for me to solve the same problem in
           the future. I am confident that I can transpose this asset of mine into debugging
           flaws in software code.                                                              </li>
       <br>
       <li><strong>Upgrades</strong><br>
           Refining the two skills above elevated me to a level where I could identify ways in
           which the product in question could be modified to better suit its intended purpose.
           Examples of where I did just this include:
           <ul>
            <li>Doubling my laptop's memory bandwidth by installing an additional RAM stick</li>
            <li>Doubling my laptop's storage capacity by replacing the M.2 SSD with a 2.5
                inch one                                                                   </li>
            <li>Reducing my PlayStation 4 loading times, doubling its storage capacity and
                reducing gameplay glitches by replacing the console stock HDD with an SSD  </li>
            <li>Improving my bike ride quality by replacing the rear inner tube with a
                self-sealing one with a higher maximum pressure rating                     </li>
           </ul>                                                                                </li>
      </ul>    
      <p>Often, when you want something done right, you have to do the work yourself. In the 
         long term, it pays dividends to reach that level of competence.                         </p>

    // The "display" will either be "monitor" or "handheld" depending on the window width

    ScreenChange(); // The function needs an initial run, otherwise the "display" will be blank
                    // until the window is resized
    window.onresize = ScreenChange; // When the window resizes, the function refires so the display
                                    // updates accordingly
