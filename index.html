   <h2>Context</h2>

   <p>My name is Patrick and I hold a master's degree in mechanical engineering. This subject
      appeals to my creative passion, along with the logical reasoning skills required to assess
      the feasibility of those concepts within the constraints of reality.<br>
      Engineering presents a fascinating dilemma of having to follow a methodical process to
      solving challenges to provide consistency in the results in accordance with best practice,
      yet also requiring novelty in the process, redefining the method to push the boundaries of
      what is considered possible with technology.                                               </p>

   <p>The curriculum involved some programming, primarily with MATLAB for solving differential
      equations, however later into my course I used Ansys and Abaqus for solid structural
      mechanics and fluid flow simulations. However the simulation softwares relied more on
      CAD and boundary conditions than manually typing scripts of code.                          </p>

   <p>Nevertheless, my education at university only covered the theoretical aspects of the 
      subject. To learn practically, I had to get my hands dirty, building upon my academic
      credentials by maintaining, repairing and in some cases even modifying domestic appliances,
      such as the family oven, bicycle and even the laptop, which at six years old is still
      running Counter Strike: Global Offensive as if it were brand new.                          </p>
  
   <p>As an extracurricular hobby, I have also studied electronics, and have become skilled at
      soldering wires and components, having designed and built circuitry for IMechE group design
      challenges in my first two years of my undergraduate course, then for my dissertation the
      following year.<br>
      In recent months, I upgraded my laptop's RAM and hard drive for increased speed and 
      capacity respectively.                                                                     </p>

   <h2>Motive</h2>

   <p>My decision to pursue web development is a cumulation of a multitude of variables at play,
      some of which are covered below:                                                           </p>

      <h3>Exploring a New Job Market</h3>
  
      <p>Despite the rising tuition fees, a university degree unfortunately is considerably less
         valuable than it used to be. With multiple mechanical engineering graduates to select 
         from, employers are spoilt for choice, and can afford to be selective, drawing a 
         Christmas list of requirements.                                                         </p>

      <p>One of those requirements is the Catch-22 of demanding years of industry-related work
         experience prior to starting the job. In other words, you need experience to land the 
         job, yet you also need the job to get the experience in the first place.                </p>

      <p>Learning to code would broaden my options for entrance into a professional technical 
         career.                                                                                 </p>
     </div>

     <div class="Cell">                             <!--Appears as a cyan box within the green box-->
      <h3>Broadening My Skill Base</h3>

      <p>Self-sufficiency is always a useful asset to possess. I find it empowering to be less
         dependant on my peers to solve my problems for me. Furthermore, being able to solve
         problems for others makes me a valuable utility, giving me great negotiating power 
         where certain situations arise.                                                         </p>

      <p>Then of course, having a high-demand skill to mention on my C.V. (even peripherally) 
         would boost my chances of landing a lucrative engineering career.                       </p>

      <p>Given how much of an integral part to society the world wide web plays, learning how it
         works would prove highly beneficial to adapting to thrive under an ever-developing 
         economy. This is elaborated upon in the next subsection.                                </p>
     </div>

     <div class="Cell">                             <!--Appears as a cyan box within the green box-->
      <h3>Marketing</h3>

      <p>Should I ever have products or services to sell, knowing how to create webistes would 
         grant me tremendous leverage with selling them, being able to establish a more 
         sophisticated brand and not having to rely on third-party sites such as Ebay. This way, 
         I can avoid having to pay commissions on sales, subsequently making my returns more 
         efficient.                                                                              </p>

      <p>Then there is the marketing of ideas.<br> Given the growing censorship on social media 
         platforms, having my own websites would enable me to share philosophies more freely,
         unconstrained by the prevailing dogmas of the day propagated by society and the state.  </p>

   <h2>Educational Progress</h2>

   <p>To prepare myselfor this course, I have worked on a couple of the projects that were 
      specified on the Founders and Coders website prior to the recent amendment.<br>
      The links to those projects can be found below:                                            </p>
