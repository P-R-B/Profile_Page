# Profile_Page
My credential background, motive for software development and links to projects.

The webpage is available at: https://p-r-b.github.io/Profile_Page/

Not all the images display properly. This is a problem with the bandwidth limitation of Github, not the codes and files themselves.

This page reuses most of the code used for my previous two projects (hobby page and project gallery), therefore typing the HMTL and CSS (along with the web-responsive Flexbox layout) was relatively straightforward. Yet on this project, I refined my CSS coding technique for improved web-response (In this case, the subsection boxes are wider when arranged in row format to make more efficient usage of the available page space, reducing the necessity for vertical scrolling).

The biggest challenge came with extending the Javascript with a conditional function that switches between two string values based on whether the subsections are arranged in row or column configuration. After much trial and error, I discovered a solution that responds well to the horizontal resizing of the window.
